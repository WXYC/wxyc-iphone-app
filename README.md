This is the official iPhone app for [WXYC](http://wxyc.org/), the community radio station at UNC-Chapel Hill where I used to run the IT Department. WXYC is a non-commercial, free format radio station. It plays an ecclectic mix of music, putting together seemingly disparate forms to highlight unsuspecting similarities.

The app basically boosts our broadcast radius to the planet. Listen to us anywhere. View the live playlist. Check out station updates. Download if from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wxyc-radio/id353182815?mt=8).
