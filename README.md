This is the official iPhone app for [WXYC](http://wxyc.org/), the student-run radio station at UNC-Chapel Hill where I used to run the IT Department. WXYC is a non-commercial, free format radio station. It plays an ecclectic mix of music, combining seemingly disparate forms to highlight interesting similarities. It's a global village. It's a small world. 

The app basically boosts our broadcast radius to the planet. Listen to us anywhere. View the live playlist. Check out station updates.

I've got some deep restructuring going on right now. I originally wrote the app as an undergrad while working on a computer science major at UNC-CH. Since my understanding of software design principles has deepened a lot. Here's some general project goals at the moment:

1. Redesign the UI. I intend to deliver a highly polished, professional design. I'm currently drafting mockups for both the listening and playlist views. They will retain the fun character of the current designs while becoming more cohesive yet simpler and cleaner.
1. Separate as many concerns as possible into individual classes. Object orient.
1. Write a testing plan. Test test test.
