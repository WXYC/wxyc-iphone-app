===============

This is the official iPhone app for [WXYC](http://wxyc.org/), the student-run radio station at UNC-Chapel Hill. WXYC is a non-commercial, free format radio station. It plays an ecclectic mix of music, combining seemingly disparate forms to highlight interesting similarities. It's a global village. It's a small world. 

The app allows you to tune in to our audio stream from anywhere â€” effectively boosting our broadcast radius to the entire planet. With it, you can also view our live playlist and station updates.

Currently this app is undergoing deep restructuring. I originally wrote the app as an undergrad while working on a computer science major at UNC-CH. Since then I've greatly deepened my understanding of software design principles. I have several primary goals:

1. Separate as many concerns as possible into individual classes. Many classes violate this principle.
1. Write a testing plan. Test test test.
1. Reorganize the project files. My original organizational scheme worked for the small project this started out as, but it's since grown into something very cluttered. Related files need to appear near each other in the project heirarchy.
1. Redesign the UI. I intend to deliver a highly polished, professional design. I'm currently drafting mockups for both the listening and playlist views. They will retain the fun character of the current designs while becoming more cohesive yet simpler and cleaner.
