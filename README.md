**The app is dead.** I poured my blood and soul into this app. Writing the WXYC app started me on a journey to where I am today as a professional developer. I can't say that the code you see here reflects the technical decisions I'd make today, but I'm grateful for the opportunities that developing the app have brought me. Building the app was a labor of love. I'll always have a WXYC-shaped hole in my heart.

This is the official iPhone app for [WXYC](http://wxyc.org/), the community radio station at UNC-Chapel Hill where I used to run the IT Department. WXYC is a non-commercial, free format radio station. It plays an ecclectic mix of music, putting together seemingly disparate forms to highlight unsuspecting similarities.

The app basically boosts our broadcast radius to the planet. Listen to us anywhere. View the live playlist. Check out station updates. Download if from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wxyc-radio/id353182815?mt=8).
